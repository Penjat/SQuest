"When the young men of Odra approach the age of Adulthood, they are required to undertake a pilgrimage known as 'The Path of the Brave'.  This journey will pit them against arduous challenges, testing their strength, determination, and courage as men.  Many will not survive this rite of passage, but those who do will become the patriarchs of their people and join the ranks of the most powerful warriors known to man.

But you, have a different journey ahead of you.
The same road, a different path."

Our game follows a youth as he is forced to embark on a rite of passage to prove his manhood.  It becomes apparent very quickly the our protagonist is not cut out for this.  Instead of fighting and killing our enemies, our hero's only hope is to seduce and satisfy their enemies sexually, or use their charms to seduce a more capable warrior of doing it for them.
